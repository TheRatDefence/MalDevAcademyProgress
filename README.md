# MalDev Academy Progress
## Overview
This repository is my attempt at keeping track of my progress throughout the [MalDev course](https://maldevacademy.com).
The projects here are all in C and coded by myself with some degree of help from the course.
If you want to run any of them, all the project files are from *Visual Studio 2022*.
 
## Warning...
I am a complete beginner to Malware Development and C, so if you attempt to go through my code ==I am not liable for any seizures or aneurysms==.
Also keep in mind this is a repository full of Malware, for most of the projects I've included a readme that specifies what it does but still **compile and run at your own risk**.
